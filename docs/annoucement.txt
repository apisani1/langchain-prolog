ðŸš€ Announcing langchain-prolog: Bringing Logic Programming to LangChain.

I'm excited to share langchain-prolog, a new integration that bridges Prolog's symbolic reasoning capabilities with LangChain's powerful LLM framework.

What is it?
langchain-prolog seamlessly integrates Prolog queries into your LLM applications, enabling rule-based reasoning, knowledge representation, and logical inference alongside your GenAI models.

Key features:
â€¢ Use Prolog queries as LangChain's Runnables and Tools in your chains and agents.
â€¢ Directly invoke Prolog predicates in LangChain applications.
â€¢ Combine symbolic reasoning with LLMs text generation.
â€¢ Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
â€¢ Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows).

See it in action:
I've created a travel route planning demo that showcases how Prolog's logic programming can enhance LLM capabilities, helping users find optimal travel routes based on complex constraints.

Special thanks to the team at @LangChain for their support in bringing this integration to life.

Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts. Try it out and let me know what you think!
